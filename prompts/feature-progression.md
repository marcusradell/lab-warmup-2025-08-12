# Feature Progression

## Goal

When a new feature is being planned, persist the plan in a new markdown file inside the folder "plans".

## Content

The plan should contain:

- An overview of the feature
- Vertically sliced parts of the feature

### Vertical slices

The vertical slices should have the following:

- A list of the technical layers needed to be implemented
- A test list to track progress of test cases

### Technical layers

The technical layers should be implemented in the following order:

1. Build a frontend with data and interactions without styling and with mocked backend
2. Replace the mocked backend with a real backend and mock the database if one is needed
3. Replace the mocked database if one was added
4. Style the frontend

Feel free to break down steps further, or remove steps that are not needed for a feature.
